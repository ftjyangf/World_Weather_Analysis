# World_Weather_Analysis project overview
### The purpose of this project is to use Api to retrieve data form word weather Api,google place Api and direction Api. Using random generated number to simulate coordinates to get vast number of cities, we got a picture of city and it's weather information from weather Api. using google place Api, we obtained location information such as hotel to plot it on world, and we get the direction route of 4 city by providing the city coordinates.

## the usage of those methods.
### At first, we were interesting in weather data of the world, but we need to provide coordinates to provide to Api to get those information. by using random number generator of numpy library. we can easily generate those number randomly and largely. 
### At Secound, we provide those coordination to goolge to retreieve the hotel infomation of those places. by using gmaps.marker_layer method we can easily plot those infomation on google world map.
### Finally, we used direction Api to generate route between 4 cities we were interested in, and plotted it in google map.
